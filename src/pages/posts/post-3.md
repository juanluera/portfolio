# Motivation: 
I believe there is potential in using technologies such as FPGA's in order to drive the progress of Autonomous driving. 
With this project I wanted to show a use case of RFSOC technology that could be incorporated with existing High speed LiDAR systems. In other words you could use RFSOC's with fast sampling rates and real time phase estimation algorithms to process the data from fast LiDAR sensors for severeal different use cases. The video above shows premptive results where where are able to determine the phase shift of an analog signal travling to and sma connector. Below you can check the results of the project more in depth.
